### Do I really suck or my power meter is lying?

I've spent last few years competing against my cycling buddy Roberto. He is objectively stronger than me, but the question always was how good am I at closing the gap in our cycling abilities.

The winter months, for example, are the times, when, during the week, we would be training indoor and track each others progress only via power numbers published on Strava. It was always quite discouraging to see that the numbers from Roberto were regularly 20-30 Watts higher than mine.

On those occasions when weather was permitting going outside we would go shoulder-to-shoulder on the open roads and observe that the power difference hardly translated into the difference in speed.

We are both the same size, the same weight, riding similar bikes and collecting power numbers from the Garmin Vector units. Given that back then we were both living in the pancake flat Netherlands, this power discrepancy at the same speed was leaving us scratching our heads in disbelief.


### Comparing absolute accuracy of Garmin Vector to Stages Power

After one starts training with a power meter it is impossible to go back so it was only a matter of time before I bough a power meter for my winter/commute bike. I've opted for Stages power this time and of course the first thing I did is to compare the head-to-head power readings from both devices.

Let's jump directly into results. Details of the actual data collection setup and processing used can be found later in the article.

### Data quality

Since I'm on the subject it would be a shame not to address the data quality from both devices. Dropped readings and unusual spikes is a normal behavior of power meters, but some suffer from these issues less than the others.
