I often use *Strava heatmap* to plan my training rides abroad, but in Brussels, where I've moved to live about a year ago, I found the *Strava heatmap* to be overpopulated by commutes. If I to plan my training rides using the heatmap, I often would find myself doing an interval training on somebodies route to the *boulangerie* or *fritterie*.

To solve the problem of planning a training ride in *Brussels*, me and my friend created a demo version of the [*Smart Strava Maps*](https://sladkovm.github.io/machine_learning/2017/08/07/Using-Machine-Learning-To-Separate-Workouts-From-Commutes.html), where, behind the scenes, AI powered filter separates commutes from workouts. Example of such map in action is shown on the animation below.

In this article, however, I would like to focus on another feature we've developed - the *Start point* filter. In order to show how it works, let me present my take on the the rich Brussels cycling scene.

### Brussels Big Brackets

This club describes itself as [*very cosmopolitan*](https://www.strava.com/clubs/brussels-big-brackets) and indeed, on every ride, there will be plenty of expats present.

The main activity of the club is a Sunday 100 km ride that starts from the *Bois de la Cambre* at 9:00. Using *Smart Strava Maps* I can place a filter at the starting point and quickly find that in May the favorite destination of this club were the hills of the *Pajottenland*.

I went with this club only once and found the tempo a bit too relaxing, but for those, who are just starting with cycling, this is a great and friendly club to join.

### Kring Dansaerts

If you are young, have no family obligations, like fast rides, long coffee breaks, expensive boutique cycling clothing and custom build frames, this up-beat cycling initiative will be for you.

All rides start at the [*Kring Dansaert*](https://www.strava.com/clubs/kringdansaert) bicycle boutique-caffe and in May the preferred rides destination were the hills around *Overijse*.

I never went with this club and can not tell much about the atmosphere during the rides.

### Groot Halle Tourist

Not officially Brussels anymore, but I found it close enough to become a member of this very traditional flemish *wielertouristen* club.

If the term *wielertourist* is not familiar to you, let me just say that some riders from the [*GHT*](http://www.groothalletoerist.be/) have proven records of riding top-30 on [*Les 3 Ballons*](http://www.grandtrophee.fr/epreuve.php?C=22) French cyclosportive. Otherwise the club is not competitive in the flemish sense of this word - meaning they don't ride *kermesse* races.

The A-team of the *GHT* is very efficient and starts it's 100+ km Sunday ride at 8:30 from the main square in *Halle*. From *Brussels* is it about 10 km along the *Brussels-Halle-Charleroi* canal.

Tempo of the A-team is [pretty high](https://www.strava.com/activities/1085858673), but for those, who can not follow, there are B- and C- teams as well.

The club, quite naturally, explores the roads west and south of Brussels.

### The Linde Peloton

The *name_of_the_caffe peloton* is a typical dutch and flemish self-organized training ride for those, who lives racing. The tempo is typically fierce and the expectations are that the participants know all written and unwritten rules of the bicycle racing. Many riders in the peloton are regulars in the *kermesse* races.

The most famous in Belgium is a *Het Schelde peloton*, but every reasonably large community will have it's own peloton. In Brussels it is [*The Linde peloton*](https://www.strava.com/clubs/102672) named after the caffe at the *Kasterlindenstraat 177, 1700 Dilbeek*.

The rides are held on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday at 9:15. Given the speed and the racing character of these rides, the parcour is typically fixed.

### What next?

The presented list is likely not complete and new additions are welcome in the comments on the blog or at my twitter [@sladkovm](https://twitter.com/sladkovm).

What concerns the *Smart Strava Maps* - it is a work in progress and is heavily shaped by engagement it creates.

Said it, of you find such map to be useful addition to the arsenal of bicycle web tools you are already using, give us *kudos* everywhere you find appropriate and do not hesitate to spread the world.
