After looking at how much Watts is needed to be competitive at [*La Marmotte des Alpes*](http://www.marmottegranfondoseries.com/epreuve.php?C=1), I could not resist and went full assault on *Strava* services to collect *Watts per Kilo* information. After all, *La Marmotte* offers *beaucoup* climbing meters and *WPK* is the only relevant metric for virtual competition.

### Going to the dark side

In contrast to [collecting *Watts*](https://sladkovm.github.io/cycling/2017/08/01/The-value-of-gold-at-La-Marmotte-des-Alpes.html), the athlete *weight* can not be fetched using the *Strava API* without explicit users permission. This is in theory. In practice, it is always possible to go some extra technical mile and get anything you want from internet.

I hope that *Strava* will not judge me harshly. After all, I am not exposing any user's sensitive information and my only goal is to celebrate the real efforts the amateur cyclist produce during the granfondo races.


### Weight is important, but Watts are *importanter*

I've plotted the *weighted Watts/kilo* as a scatter plot. The size of each point on a plot represents the actual power.

Results are grouped according to the medal earned and coded into graphs as *gold*, *silver* and *bronze* respectively.

The boundaries between different medals distributions are soft due to the fact that the time-cuts are different for each age category. I've shown the time-cuts for *gold* performance as vertical grid lines.

The grey-shaded band behind the scatters represents the prediction intervals calculated using *power-time regression model*.

What I found the most remarkable is that *top-100* riders can sustain the mind blowing *4.0 Watts/kg* not only because they are feather weight, but mainly due to the high absolute power output.

For the rest of us - middle aged men with families, full time jobs and data crunching hobbies, the *2.8 Watts/kg* over *8 hours* would be more than sufficient to ride *gold* at *La Marmotte des Alpes*.

Details of my ride can be found on [*Strava*](https://www.strava.com/activities/1069498347).
