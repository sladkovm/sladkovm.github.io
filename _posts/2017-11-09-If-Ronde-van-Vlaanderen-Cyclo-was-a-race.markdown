*De Ronde van Vlaanderen* is one of the greatest races on the cycling calendar. The professional version of the race culminates the Belgian spring cobbles classics and is held on the first Sunday of April.

It is a great pleasure to [watch the race from the sidelines](https://youtu.be/fjES2MRjSmg) while enjoying the Belgian beer, but it is even more fun to test the grit of the *cobbles, bergs and [betonwegen](http://inrng.com/2013/03/the-betonweg/)* yourself at the amateur version of the race the day before.


### Is it a race? Is it a tour? It is a *Toertocht*!

Cycling is the second biggest sport in Belgium after football and the amateur federation reports more than a million members. For a country with population slightly more than 10 million people, it is 1 in 10 citizens.

Any cycling event in Belgium attracts so many participants that closing the roads and holding a proper race is simply not practical. What is a Belgian solution to the problem? A *Toertocht*.

A *Toertocht* is an organized mass cycling event with an entourage of a bicycle race, but without a time keeping. The amateur cyclists participating in the *Toertochten* are typically categorized as *wielertoeristen*.

The [*Ronde van Vlaanderen Cyclo*](http://www.sport.be/werideflanders/2017/en/) or *We Ride Flanders* - as it is known by commercial name, is one of the biggest *Toertochten* events on the Belgian calendar. The event in fact is so big, that participation requires registration in advance and starting numbers are being sold quite quickly.

I had a pleasure to [ride this event twice](https://youtu.be/UiAVI57fV2s) and must confess - it is a great experience. For many, to finish the amateur *Ronde* is a challenge in its own right, but some treat it as a race and give it all they've got.


### Virtual ranking and performance prediction on *Velometria*

I've found it rather unfortunate that the *tourtochten* do not keep the time. To resolve this omission I've created the service [*Velometria*](http://velometria.com/). It collects *Strava* data for many cycling events and serves the collected information in form of visualized *finishing time* distribution alongside the *weighted power* in *Watts* or *Watts/kg*.

[![Velometria Ronde Van Vlaanderen Cyclo 141]({{site.url}}/assets/2017-11-09-RVV-Cyclo/rvv_141.gif)](http://velometria.com/events/rvv-141-cyclo-2017)

If you took part in the event now you can compare your finishing time with other cyclist and estimate how high would you rank if the *Toertocht* was a race.

For registered *Strava* users the *Velometria* will also analyze your recent cycling performance and would try to predict the *finishing time* if the event was held today.

### We are only starting

*Velometria* is a work in progress with a mission to utilize the vast array of cycling data collected by *Strava* users and provide the novel insights into the amateur cycling events we all love.

At the moment of writing the service is in its *alpha* stage and can be sketchy in places. I would love to hear all suggestion and recommendations on how to improve the existing features and absolutely welcome any bug reports.
