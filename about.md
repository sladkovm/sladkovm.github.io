Personal blog about cycling, data science, web development and how exercise all three of these fields at the same time.

It might not be apparent from this blog, but I have a *PhD degree in experimental physics*, spent 6 awesome years racing the *Moor's low* and currently working on bringing *3D vision* to our everyday life. All you need to know about me as a professional is summarized on [Linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sladkovm/).
