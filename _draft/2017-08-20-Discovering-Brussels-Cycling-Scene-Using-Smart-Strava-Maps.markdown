When I've moved to the *Netherlands* almost 15 years ago I've adopted bicycle as a primary mode of transportation. Even after relocating to *Brussels* I did not give up on it and bring my children to school, do the groceries and commute to work exclusively by bike. Basically I have no idea which tram would bring me from my house to the *Manneken Pis*.

Am I a special one? Not at all. In the *Netherlands* and *Belgium* many people do the same and this creates very peculiar problem for those, who uses cycling not only for commute, but practice it as a sport.

### Brussels Big Brackets


### Kring Dansaerts


### Groot Halle Tourist


### The Linde Peloton


### My 5 cents

I often use [*Strava route builder*](https://www.strava.com/routes) to design my training rides. In combination with [*Strava heat map*](http://labs.strava.com/heatmap/#6/-106.30371/38.89958/blue/bike), it works magic in finding the most ridden roads everywhere in Europe, be it *Spain*, *Italy* or *France*. *Strava* will always unambiguously find the way to the *Col de Rates*, *Passo Pordoi* or *Col du Galibier*.

When it comes to the *Netherlands* and *Belgium* - the story is completely different. As an exercise, I challenge you to plan a ride from *Oudenaarde* to the cobbles of *Koppenberg* or *Oude Kwaremont*. I bet you will quickly get lost in the mesmerizing mesh of the roads all ever ridden by bicycle.

It all looks very impressive on the zoomed out heat map, but the shear popularity of bicycle as a primary mode of transportation renders *Strava heat map* completely useless for workout route planning in this part of the world.
